1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server side routing requests a page from the server. It's normally done just like client side routing where the user clicks on something (a link, button, etc) and requests data from the server.

Client side routing is done independently of the server it's on. It alters the state through routes to determine the content shown. There are many ways/frameworks to do routing, React is just the one we happen to be working with. It also enhances data grabbing because it can grab dynamically generated data.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
    http stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It can be accessed a few different ways, but for our purpose it's done to describe the current location of a user on the website.

1.  What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. These are the 4 mostly used interactions with data that we see, however, there are more.

1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    The verbs. There are a lot. I've known them as RESTful kind of stuff. Post, get, put, delete, but also patch (which I've never used.)

1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
    Fetch, axios, jquery, vanilla js using xmlhttprequest.
